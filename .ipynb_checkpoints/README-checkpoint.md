# Poker Hand Selection with Deep Reinforcement Learning 

Train an agent to select the best five card poker hand from random cards with deep reinforcement learning. Create a custom [**OpenAI `gym`**](https://gym.openai.com/) environment and then work with [**Stable baselines**](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to build an agent. 

* `HandMakerEnv` implements a `gym` environment where an agent must select the best five-card poker hand from 13 cards drawn randomly from the deck

* `AgentTraining` contains files for training agents on the environment

* `notebook_dev` contains files for development and misc materials
