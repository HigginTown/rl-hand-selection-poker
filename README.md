# Poker Hand Selection with Deep Reinforcement Learning 

Train an agent to select the best five card poker hand from random cards with deep reinforcement learning. Create a custom [**OpenAI `gym`**](https://gym.openai.com/) environment and then work with [**Stable baselines**](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to build an agent. 

* `Environments` implement `gym` environments where the goal is to perform tasks related to five card poker hands, such as classification, selecting the best five card hand from many cards, and playing Open Face Chinese Poker

* `AgentTraining` contains files for training agents in the environments

* `requirements.txt` will be updated with a better way to replicate the environment used for training
